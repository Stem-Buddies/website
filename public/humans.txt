/* MESSAGE */
    Hey there, future scientists! Remember:
    Stay curious, ask questions, and never stop exploring.
    The world is full of wonders waiting to be discovered.
    You might just be the one to make the next big breakthrough!

    PS: Did you know that if you could fold a piece of paper 42 times,
    it would reach the moon? Too bad paper can only be folded 7 times max!
    But that doesn't mean you can't reach for the stars in other ways!
