# Brilliant Boffins: Dorothy Hodgkin - The Crystal Mastermind

Description: Discover the fascinating story of Dorothy Hodgkin, a brilliant scientist who used crystals to solve some of medicine's biggest mysteries. This article is perfect for young science enthusiasts aged 7-10 who love learning about real-life superheroes.

Hello, young scientists! Today, we're going to meet an amazing woman who had a very special superpower. Her name was Dorothy Hodgkin, and she could see inside molecules!

## Meet Dorothy

Dorothy was born in 1910 in Cairo, Egypt. From a young age, she was fascinated by crystals and chemistry. She would collect crystals and study their beautiful shapes. Little did she know that this hobby would lead her to change the world!

## X-ray Vision

Dorothy's superpower wasn't really X-ray vision, but it was pretty close! She used a technique called X-ray crystallography. This allowed her to figure out the shape and structure of molecules by looking at how X-rays bounced off crystals of these molecules. It was like solving a super tricky 3D puzzle!

## Penicillin's Secret Structure

One of Dorothy's biggest achievements was working out the structure of penicillin. Penicillin is a medicine that fights infections, but nobody knew exactly what it looked like. Dorothy's work helped doctors understand how penicillin worked, which meant they could make it better and save even more lives.

## Cracking the Vitamin B12 Code

Dorothy's next big challenge was vitamin B12. This vitamin is really important for our bodies, but its structure was a mystery. It took Dorothy and her team 12 years to solve this puzzle! Her discovery helped doctors treat a serious illness called pernicious anaemia.

## Insulin: The Diabetes Detective

Dorothy's biggest project was working out the structure of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps our bodies use sugar for energy. Understanding its structure was crucial for treating diabetes. It took Dorothy more than 30 years to complete this work!

## Nobel Prize Winner

In 1964, Dorothy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work. This is one of the biggest awards a scientist can get. She was only the third woman ever to win this prize in Chemistry!

## Inspiring Others

Dorothy wasn't just a brilliant scientist; she was also a great teacher. She inspired many students, especially women, to become scientists. She believed that everyone should have the chance to study science, no matter who they were.

## Fun Crystal Facts

Did you know you can grow your own crystals at home? Try mixing salt or sugar with warm water, then hang a string in the solution and watch crystals form! Crystals are used in lots of things, from watches to computers.

## Be a Crystal Mastermind

Dorothy Hodgkin showed us that with curiosity and hard work, we can uncover nature's secrets. Her work has helped millions of people around the world. Who knows? Maybe you'll be the next crystal mastermind to make a big discovery!

Remember, science is for everyone. So keep asking questions, stay curious, and who knows what amazing things you might discover!
