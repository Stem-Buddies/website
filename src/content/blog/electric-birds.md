# Why Don't Feathery Friends Get Zapped?

## A Shocking Discovery Awaits

Have you ever spotted birds perched on electric wires and wondered, "How do they avoid getting electrocuted?" Well, my curious friends, it's time to unravel this electrifying mystery! Get ready to embark on an adventure filled with sparkling facts and sizzling experiments that will leave you buzzing with excitement!

## Conductor or Insulator? The Key to Staying Safe

First things first, let's understand what makes something a conductor or an insulator. Conductors are materials that allow electricity to flow through them easily, like metal wires. On the other hand, insulators are materials that resist the flow of electricity, like rubber or plastic.

Birds don't get electrocuted on power lines because they are not connected to the ground! As long as they don't provide a path for the electricity to flow from the wire to the ground, they remain safe and sound. It's as simple as that!

## A Shocking Experiment

Want to see this in action? Grab an adult's help and try this simple experiment:

1. Inflate a balloon and rub it against your hair or a wool sweater. This creates static electricity!
2. Hold the balloon close to a thin stream of water from the faucet.
3. Watch as the stream of water gets attracted to the charged balloon, just like how birds can safely perch on electric wires without getting zapped!

## Fun Facts to Spark Your Curiosity

- Birds have excellent balance, allowing them to navigate the wires with ease.
- Their lightweight bodies and excellent insulation from their feathers also help them stay safe.
- However, if a bird touches both a live wire and a grounded surface simultaneously, it could get electrocuted.

## Conclusion: Explore the Electrifying World Around You

Now that you know the secret behind why birds don't get electrocuted, keep exploring the fascinating world of electricity and energy! There are so many more mind-boggling mysteries waiting to be uncovered. Who knows, you might even become a brilliant boffin yourself one day!
