# Brilliant Boffins: Marie Curie - The Glowing Scientist

Hello there, future scientists! Today we're going to meet one of the coolest scientists ever - Marie Curie. Imagine a scientist who could make things glow in the dark without any batteries or electricity. Sounds like magic, doesn't it? Well, that's exactly what Marie Curie did!

## Who Was Marie Curie?

Marie Curie was born in Poland a long time ago, in 1867. That's over 150 years ago! Even as a little girl, Marie loved learning. She was ever so curious about how things worked, just like you!

## The Big Adventure

When Marie grew up, she moved to Paris to go to university. That's where she met another scientist named Pierre Curie. They fell in love and got married. Talk about a science power couple!

## The Glowing Discovery

Marie and Pierre worked together to study something called "elements". Elements are like the building blocks of everything around us. And guess what? They found something brand new that nobody had ever seen before!

They discovered that some elements could give off energy and even glow in the dark all by themselves. They called this amazing ability "radioactivity". Marie found two new elements that did this: polonium and radium. Imagine finding something that glows without any batteries!

## Why It's Important

Marie's discoveries were jolly important. They helped doctors make X-rays, which let them see inside our bodies without cutting us open. Wow! Her work also helps treat some diseases today.

## Fun Facts About Marie

1. Marie Curie was the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize. That's like winning a gold medal in the Olympics, but for science!
2. She's the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different types of science. Double wow!

## Try It Yourself: Glow-in-the-Dark Slime

Want to make something glow like Marie Curie's discoveries? Let's make some safe, glow-in-the-dark slime!

You'll need:

- Clear glue
- Borax
- Water
- Glow-in-the-dark powder (ask a grown-up to help you get this)

Mix the ingredients carefully (get a grown-up to help), and voila! You've got glowing slime. It's not radioactive like Marie's elements, but it's still brilliant!

## You Can Be a Scientist Too

Marie Curie's curiosity about the world led her to make amazing discoveries. She showed us that with hard work and lots of questions, anyone can be a great scientist.

So keep asking questions, stay curious, and who knows? Maybe you'll be the next Marie Curie, making incredible discoveries that change the world!

Remember, science isn't just about lab coats and test tubes. It's about exploring the world around you and figuring out how things work. So go out there and start exploring!
